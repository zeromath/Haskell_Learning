# Haskell Learning

Here is a collection of my codes along my way of learning Haskell.

# Folders

- The `Practices` folder contains some implementation of classical algorithms.
- The `ProjectEuler` folder contains my Haskell solutions to some of the problems in [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/).
- The `Codewars` folder contains my Haskell solutions to some of the problems in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). This is my Codewarrior Profile Badge with current status: ![My Codewarrior Profile Badge](https://www.codewars.com/users/zerojz/badges/micro)
