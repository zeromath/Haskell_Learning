# Description

This is a solution to the question [Insane Coloured Triangles](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a331ea7ee1aae8f24000175)

# Explanation

Let `R, G, B` be represented by numbers 0, 1, 2. Then the inductive step is generated by `\x y -> mod (2*(x+y)) 3`.

Assume that the initial sequence is given by `x_1, ... ,x_n`. Then the final result is `2^n * ( sum_(k=0)^n (n \choose k) * x_k )`.

Then we make use of the [Lucas's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%27s_theorem).

Since the trinary expansion `n` of a number only consists of 0, 1, and 2, by Lucas's theorem, we only need to consider `i` (`i <= n`) such that the each trinay bit of `i` is smaller than that of `n`. For example, say `trinaryExpansion n = 201`. Then we only need to consider `i` where `trinayExpansion i = 000 | 001 | 100 | 101 | 200 | 201`. When applying Lucas's theorem to `(n \choose i)`, we note that only `(2 \choose 1)` gives us 2 while everything else gives us 1. That's how we get the function `binaryCoefficientMod3`. The remaining codes are straightforward. __The only caveat__ is that both `trinaryExpansion` and `numOfTriExpansion` are in reversed order.
