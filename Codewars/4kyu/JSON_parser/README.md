# Description

This is a solution to the question [JSON Parser](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55aa170b54c32468c30000a9)


# Explanation

The description is a mess. There two important caveats:

1. One should ignore all the whitespaces. There are actually a lot of them

2. Numbers with leading zeros are illegal.

There may be more caveats if you are not famailiar with JSON. Even if you do, you will still find this kata confusing.
